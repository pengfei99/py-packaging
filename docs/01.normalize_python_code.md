# Normalize python code

When you publish a python code, you should normalize your code, so everyone can read it and understand it easily.
In this doc, we will learn:
- how the python code naming convention works
- how to keep your code clean and respect coding standard
    - how to use tools such as `black`, "pylint" to keep your code clean(code lint). 
    - how to use tools such as `isort` to clean imports
    - how to use `type hint` and use tool such as `` to do static check
- how to [document the code](./02.Document_python_code.md)
- how to [test the code](./03.Test_python_code.md)
- how to versioning the code

## 1. Naming convention

The python naming convention is defined in **PEP08**. For more details, you should visit the official page of PEP.

### 1.1 Package

A **package name** should always be in `lowercase letters`, and separate words with `underscores` only if necessary.

```text
my_package   # Good ✅
mypackage    # Good (preferred if short) ✅
MyPackage    # Bad (avoid CamelCase for packages) ❌ 
myPackage    # Bad (mixed case is not recommended) ❌ 
```

### 1.2 Module

A **module name** should always be in `lowercase letters`, and separate words with `underscores` only if it improves readability.

```text
my_module.py   # Good ✅
mymodule.py    # Good (preferred if short) ✅
MyModule.py    # Bad (avoid CamelCase for packages) ❌ 
myModule.py    # Bad (mixed case is not recommended) ❌ 
my-module.py   # Not allowed (hyphens are not allowed) ❌❌
```

### 1.3 Class

A class name should be in CamelCase (PascalCase).

```text
class MyClass:   # Good ✅
    pass

class my_class:  # Bad (use CamelCase) ❌ 
    pass

class my_class:   # Bad (not readable) ❌ 
    pass
```

### 1.4 Function/Method

A **function/method** name should use the `snake_case (lowercase with underscores)`.

```text
def my_function():  # Good ✅
    pass

def MyFunction():   # Bad (looks like a class) ❌ 
    pass

def myFunction():   # Bad (mixed case is not recommended) ❌ 
    pass
```

### 1.5 Variable

Use `snake_case` for variable names.

```text
my_variable = 38   # Good ✅
MyVariable = 38    # Bad (avoid CamelCase for variables) ❌ 
myVariable = 38    # Bad (mixed case is not recommended) ❌ 
```

### 1.6 Constant

```text
MY_CONSTANT = 38  # Good ✅
pi = 3.14        # Bad (constants should be in ALL_CAPS) ❌ 
```

### 1.7 Custom exception 

The custom exception name should be in `CamelCase` and end with `Error`.

```text
class DataProcessingError(Exception):  # Good ✅
    pass

class Data_Error(Exception):  # Bad (no underscores in class names) ❌ 
    pass
```

## 2. Private and Protected Members of Python class 

In a python class, you can define:
- `private` attributes/methods with a single underscore _ .
- `strong private` attributes/methods with a double underscore __ (name mangling) .

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public_var = 42         # Public attribute
        self._protected_var = 99      # Protected attribute (convention)
        self.__private_var = 100      # Private attribute (name mangling)

    def _helper_method(self):         # Protected method
        pass

    def __internal_method(self):      # Private method
        pass

```

> Another class can still access the protected attribute of a class, it's only a naming convention that tells other users
> you should not use it.
> 
> 

## 3. Keep your code clean and readable

We have seen the naming convention for python packages, classes, etc. Python also has other convention on how to write
the code(e.g. line length,). We can use tools such as `pylint` and `black` to help you keep your code inline with these
conventions. 


### 3.1 pylint 

**pylint** is a tool that checks for `anomalies(violating a coding standard)` in source code, giving us immediate 
feedbacks. After analyzing the code it gives an overall score out of 10 along with `anomalies details` in the source 
code.

```shell
pip install pylint

# analyse code quality of all files in a directory
pylint ./src/stock_catcher

```

You can customize the coding standard which pylint uses in `.pylintrc` . If you provide nothing, a default one will be used.
You can find an example of `.pylintrc` in appendix


### 3.2 Use black to format your source code

pylint can detect the `anomalies`, but you need to correct them by yourself. **black** is a great tool for 
formatting your Python code automatically.

```shell
pip install black

black ./src/stock_catcher
```

### 3.3. Use isort to format your import

**isort** automatically sorts and organizes imports.

```shell
pip install isort

# use the default config, if you have config in your pyproject.toml, the provided config will be used
isort ./src/stock_catcher

# you can also use the black profile
isort --profile=black
```
### 3.4 Type checking with mypy

Mypy is a static type checker for Python. But it only checks the function with type hints, if you have nothing in function
definition, it will do nothing.

```shell
pip install mypy
mypy ./src/stock_catcher
```
